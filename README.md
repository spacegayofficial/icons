!!**Updated all files so the subject is brighter against the background**!!

Absolutely no credit is necessary, but a reblog on my [tumblr post](https://butchmandalorian.tumblr.com/post/724308362185080832/download-ur-preferred-icons-here) would be appreciated! Thanks! <3

All planned icons are done!

Icons in this repository: 2 flavors of Din Djarin, 4 flavors of Dieter Bravo, Dio Morrissey, Ezra, Frankie Morales, Javi Gutierrez, 3 flavors of Javier PeÃ±a, Joel Miller, Marcus Moreno, Marcus Pike, Max Phillips, 2 flavors of Maxwell Lord, Oberyn Martell, the thief, Tovar, Veracruz, Whiskey

FLAGS INCLUDED IN EACH SET: 7 stripe pride, ace, aro, Baker pride, bi, butch lesbian, genderqueer, intersex, lesbian, nonbinary, pan, Philly pride, and trans

**KNOWN ISSUES**: 

-Whiskey's and one of Javi P's pictures block out the entirety of the bottom half of the flag. I'm thinking about ways to rectify this. I may just make another Whiskey icon. There are two other Javi P flavors to choose from.

-Frankie, the thief, and blurry Dieter are still very dark despite me lightening the shit out of them. I'm not going to fix blurry Dieter because that was mostly a joke to begin with, but I may find different shots of the other two to make additional icons.

If you have requests for additional characters, shots of characters, flags, or you have other issues/concerns/questions, [please let me know!](https://butchmandalorian.tumblr.com/ask)
